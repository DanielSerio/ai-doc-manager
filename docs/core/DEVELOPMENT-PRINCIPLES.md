# Development Principles

## Project Structure

1. Use a modular project structure. (see [PROJECT-STUCTURE.md](./PROJECT-STUCTURE.md) for details)
2. Use barrel files for exports.

## Code Style

1. ALWAYS prefer simple solutions over complex or clever solutions.
2. ALWAYS use the SOLID principles.
3. DO YOUR BEST to use the DRY principles.
4. DO YOUR BEST to use the YAGNI principle.

## Typescript

1. Excluding constant, mock-data, `use[Feature]Columns` hooks, and test files, ALL `.ts` and `.tsx` files should be under 201 lines of code.
2. NEVER use `any` type.
3. PREFER inference over explicit typing.


## React

### General:

1.  Ensure components and hooks are pure and idempotent.
2.  Treat props and state as immutable; avoid direct modification.

### Component Patterns:
 
1. Prefer functional components and React Hooks over class components for new development.
2. Utilize custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components.
3. Employ the Context API for managing global or application-wide state where prop drilling becomes cumbersome.

### Hook Patterns: 

1. `use[Feature]s` hooks should return `[state, methods] as const`.
2. data-table columns should be defined in `use[Feature]Columns` hooks.

### Project Structure:

1. Use modular project structure. (ex: `src/components/[feature]/[feature].tsx`)
2. Use `src/hooks/[feature]/[feature].tsx` or `src/hooks/[feature].tsx` for custom hooks.
3. Use `src/lib/utils/[feature]/[feature].tsx` or `src/lib/utils/[feature].ts` for utility functions.
4. Use `src/lib/schemas/[feature].ts` for Zod schemas. 
5. Component files in `src/components/ui/` and any hook files generated by `shadcn/ui` should use the `kebab-case` naming convention.
6. All other component and hook files should use the `camelCase` naming convention for hooks and `PascalCase` for components.

## Testing

1. Do NOT write unit tests. They are a waste of effort.
2. Integration and e2e tests should use `playwright`.
3. Keep test cases simple and focused.
4. AVOID mocking in tests.
5. ALWAYS use `testid` selectors for testing.

## Shadcn

1. Use `shadcn/ui` for UI components.
2. When building custom components, use primitive shadcn components as building blocks where possible.
3. Try not to modify generated shadcn components.
